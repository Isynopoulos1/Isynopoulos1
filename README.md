<h1>Hello world ‚ò∫Ô∏è</h1>

I'm Isela and I'm a UI/UX Designer and Junior Frontend Developer with a strong passion for design, arts, cooking, digital tendencies & cinema.

I also have a huge interest in Web development and currently I'm getting a solid foundation in programming.
So It's reflected by my knowledge in HTML, CSS, SASS, and a basic level in Python and Javascript with libraries such as React and Nodejs.
I also enjoy building sites and implementing a design system üî∫‚óºÔ∏è üî∑

What I do:

UI-UX: Design System, User-centered design, Design Thinking Methodology,
User Personas, Affinity Mapping, User Journey, User Flows, Wireframing, Visual Design,
Motion design in Figma, User-interaction Design, Prototyping, Video animation, and motion graphics in After Effects.
Web development: HTML, CSS, SASS
Code: Basic Javascript, React.

My profile matches such a hybrid between Product designer and Junior Web Developer.
In fact, I do love to work in both areas equally!
