<h1>Hello world ✌🏽</h1>

I'm a Frontend Developer with a background as Product designer over 10 years. 


I have been working as a front end developer for the past 2 years, and I am motivated to continue growing and developing my skills. 

My curiosity and interest in Web development took me to learn new tools such as HTML, CSS, SASS, languages as Javascript with libraries such as React and Nodejs and most recently Python and Vue.
One of the things that I enjoy the most is building sites and implementing a design system. 🔺 ◼️ 🔹

Motion design in Figma, User-interaction Design, Prototyping, Video animation, and motion graphics in After Effects.

Web development: HTML, CSS, SASS

Code: Javascript, React, Nodejs, Python and Vue.
